# Hung Up

An application I designed to help beat decision fatigue while getting dressed.

## User Stories

I created this project with the vision of an application that lets users:

- Populate a database with their own existing articles of clothing
- Create outfits based on those clothing items
- Enter details, values, and images for their clothing pieces and outfits
- View and sort their clothing by type
